Third assignment: Paths with curved segments and gradient paints.
-----------------------------------

Now that we can draw polygons and ellipses, we move to the
most common vector graphics primitive: paths with curved
segments.

To simplify the task, we provide the "skeleton" driver
"render.lua" that invokes two functions you have to
implement yourselves: "preparescene", and "sample".
Naturally, as you organize your code, these functions may
invoke other functions you implemented. You can reuse all
the work you did for the second assignment, and try to
improve.

We are also providing a new version of rvg.lua that contains
some sample code showcasing the new iterator syntax for path
content. Read the code and maybe you will find something
useful.

Proceed in the following order with the assignment.

Start by getting linear and quadratic segments to work.
Test them with the file

    hello-ttf.rvg

Then add cubics, and test them with the file

    hello-type1.rvg

Remember that we are providing the modules quadratic.lua and
cubic.lua that can be used to solve quadratic and cubic
equations.

If you have not finished gradient paints yet, now is the
time to work on them. These have recently been covered in
class and there is bibliography for them as well.

    lineargradient.rvg
    radialgradient.rvg

Finally, make sure the transformed gradients also work

    xformedlineargradient.rvg
    xformedradialgradient.rvg

Now you can render one of the prettiest images in the
sample set

    drops.rvg

In theory, you should also be able to render the

    page.rvg

file, but using the current algorithm it will probably take
too long to render.

We will learn about acceleration datastructures soon.

Good luck!
